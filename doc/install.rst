IdProxy is at experimental stage and therefore it has some dependencies to the head versions of other projects.


Quick install
-------------
The fastes way to install IdProxy is to use Yais. Yais is only supported by debian based systems, so for all other systems you have to use the manual approach.

First install yais: ::

    sudo â€“u dirgadmin git clone https://github.com/its-dirg/yais
    cd yais
    sudo python setup.py install

Now you can use yais to install various softwares from DIRG. ::

    ./yaisLinux.sh /[..]/projects

You have to point out the full path to your install directory, relative path do not work with Yais, and you may NOT end the path with a slash.

You will be asked to answer some quistions about what programs you want to install. You only need to answer Y to the IdPproxy question. ::

    Do you want to install IdPproxy (Y/n):

Beware that after you have choosen the software you want to install you will get more questions about the dependencies that will be installed with apt-get. To be sure that everything works you have to install all the dependencies.

When everything has been installed you will be asked to configure pysaml example IdP and SP. Answer no to this question unless you want to setup a test IdP and SP.
